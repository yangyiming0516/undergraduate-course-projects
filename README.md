## Visualization
Some visualization implemented with D3.js. There are different designs for different datasets.
### hotel

Guests data in a hotel during each month, including sex, booking type, age, source, etc. 
#### design
pie and histogram charts are used to display different attributes.  
the data of each month can be selected.  
the charts are interactive so different parts of the data can be added to the line chart to show the trend of each month.
