## Visualization
Some visualization implemented with D3.js. There are different designs for different datasets.
### hotel
[demo link](http://vis.pku.edu.cn/course/Visualization_2014F/hotel/yangyiming/)
#### dataset
Guests data in a hotel during each month, including sex, booking type, age, source, etc. 
#### design
pie and histogram charts are used to display different attributes.  
the data of each month can be selected.  
![pie&histogram charts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yangyiming0516/undergraduate-course-projects/master/Visualization/hotel/sample1.png)
the charts are interactive so different parts of the data can be added to the line chart to show the trends of each month.

### wine
[demo link](http://vis.pku.edu.cn/course/Visualization_2014F/wine/yangyiming/)
#### dataset
High-dimensional data of multiple attributes of different of wine
#### design
![sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yangyiming0516/undergraduate-course-projects/master/Visualization/wine/sample.png)  
Parallel axis chart is used, the axis can be dragged.  
A scatter chart is used to observe the relation between two specific attributes, the attributes can be chosen.  
The amount of different kinds of wine selected are displayed by histograms.  
All charts are interactive, the data chosen in one chart are also selected correspondingly in other charts.

### weibo
[demo link](http://vis.pku.edu.cn/course/Visualization_2014F/final_project/group5/)
#### dataset
SNS data from weibo, containing gps and post content.
#### degisn
![sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yangyiming0516/undergraduate-course-projects/master/Visualization/weibo/sample.png)  
A heatmap shows the distribution of the messages posted. Areas can be chosen.

A trend chart shows the amount of weibo posted one different time. Time scopes can be chosen.
![time](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yangyiming0516/undergraduate-course-projects/master/Visualization/weibo/time.png)  
Histograms show the amount of weibo selected by area or time. There are also functions such as animation or zooming of the time axis.
